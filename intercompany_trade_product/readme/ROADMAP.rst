* Round sale price to make it compatible with purchase prices.

* add an extra ratio to have the possibility to link a supplier product
  'pack of 6 bottles' to a customer product 'bottle'. Link a product should
  divide prices by 6. (or use Purchase UoM)

* Supplierinfo should be readonly in intercompany trade for customer, for
  consistency reason. (not a big deal, because only supplier can now
  create invoices)
